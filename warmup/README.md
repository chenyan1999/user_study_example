## Project description
Code in `warm up.py` describes a linked list class, that add and remove nodes from the head of the list.

## Edit Warm Up
We wish to add a new attribute `self.size` to the class, that will record the length of the list, when the list add new node or remove a node. The length can be acquired by `len()` function, so we also need to define a method named `__len__()`

You may test your edited code by running `python validation`.
